NumPy Datatypes Cheatsheet

The datatypes for NumPy have a strong relation with datatypes in C, as NumPy is programmed in C.
Regular python lists tend to be much slower, because they have a lot of overhead. NumPy prevents
the overhead by only allowing a singular datatype in each list. While the python array is also efficient,
we will see that NumPy also offers us easy operations for this data, making it the superior choice for
data management of any kind.

Numpy and Integers

NumPy has several different types of integers. These integers can be unsigned (uint), indicating 
that they are only able to hold 0 or positive values. We can distinguish between these types 
by looking at the number of bits they take up and take the bit for the sign into account to get 
to the following ranges:

Unsigned (positive values only):
np.uint8     8 bits      0 to 2^8-1       0-255         Notice that we have to subtract one to store zero
np.uint16    16 bits     0 to 2^16-1      0-65536   
np.uint32    32 bits     0 to 2^32-1      0-4294967295
np.uint64    64 bits     0 to 2^64-1      0-18446744073709551615

Signed (positive & negative values):
np.int8     8 bits      -2^(8-1)  to 2^(8-1) - 1        -128 to 127
np.int16    16 bits     -2^(16-1) to 2^(16-1) - 1       -32768 to 32767
np.int32    32 bits     -2^(32-1) to 2^(32-1) - 1       -2147483648 to 2147483647
np.int64    64 bits     -2^(64-1) to 2^(64-1) - 1       -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
